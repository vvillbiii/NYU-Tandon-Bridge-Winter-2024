# fundmental concepts in logical reasoning
1. Propositions and Logical Operations

    - Definition: Logic is the study of formal reasoning.
    - Propositions: Statements that are either true or false.
    - Example: "There are an infinite number of prime numbers" (True).

2. The Conjunction Operation

    - Propositional variables (e.g., p, q, r) represent arbitrary propositions.
    - Compound propositions: Created by connecting propositions with logical operations.
    - Example: "p ∧ q" denotes "p and q".

3. The Disjunction Operation

    - Denoted by ∨.
    - Example: "p ∨ q" means "p or q".

4. Negation Operation

    - Acts on a single proposition, reversing its truth value.
    - Example: "¬p" denotes "not p".

5. Conditional Statements

    - Denoted by →.
    - Example: "p → q" read as "if p then q".

6. The Biconditional Operation

    - Denoted by ↔.
    - Example: "p ↔ q" means "p if and only if q".
