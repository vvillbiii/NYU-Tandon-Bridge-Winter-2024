# 2.2 Introduction to proofs

- A theorem is a statement that can be proven to be true.
    - ex. Every positive integer is less than or equal to its square.
- A proof consists of a series of steps, each of which follows logically from assumptions, or from previously proven statements, whose final step should result in the statement of the theorem being proven.
- Axioms, which are statements assumed to be true.
- A proof may also make use of previously proven theorems.
- A proof should read like a verbal argument designed to convince a skeptical listener that an assertion is true.


- In computer science, proofs are important for establishing that a program works as expected, showing that a cryptosystem is secure, or validating a set of inferences in artificial intelligence, to name a few applications.

## Theorems that are universal or existential statements
* Most theorems are an assertion about all the elements in a set and are therefore universal statements. 
* A universal statement does not necessarily explicitly use words associated with a universal quantifier, such as "for all" or "for every".


## Proofs of universal statements: proofs by exhaustion
- If a universal statement has a small domain, the easiest way to prove it might be through proof by exhaustion. This method involves checking every single element of the domain individually to ensure the statement holds true for each one.


## Proofs of universal statements: universal generalization


A counterexample is an assignment of values to variables that shows that a universal statement is false.
