# Proofs 

## 2.1 Introduction to proofs
- A theorem is a statement that can be proven true using logical reasoning steps called a proof. (Ex: Every integer is less than or equal to its square)
- Proofs use previously proven facts, axioms assumed to be true, and rules of logic to show a theorem is true.(Ex: Use algebra to show n2 ≥ n for any integer n)
- Proofs should be written clearly like a verbal argument to convince a skeptical reader. 
- Common proof techniques include direct proof, proof by contradiction, proof by contrapositive, and proof by cases.

## 2.2 Direct proofs
- Direct proof assumes the hypothesis is true and uses logic/previous theorems to deduce the conclusion.  (Ex: Assume n is odd. Show n2 is odd.)
- Useful for proving conditional "if-then" statements by starting with the assumption of the "if" part.

## 2.3 Proof by contrapositive 
- Assumes the negation of the conclusion is true and deduces the negation of the hypothesis. (Ex: Show if n2 is even then n is even)
- Useful when the negation of the conclusion is easier to work with than the original hypothesis.

## 2.4 Proof by contradiction
- Assumes the statement is false and shows this assumption leads to a logical contradiction. (Ex: Assume √2 is rational. Show this leads to a contradiction)
- More general technique than direct proof or contrapositive because it can prove non-conditional statements. 

## 2.5 Proof by cases
- Breaks the domain into exhaustive cases and proves the theorem separately for each case. (Ex: Let n be even or odd, prove in both cases n2 - n is even)
- Useful when no single argument works for the entire domain but dividing into cases makes the proof manageable.
