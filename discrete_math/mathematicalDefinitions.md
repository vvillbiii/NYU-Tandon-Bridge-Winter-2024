# 2.1 Mathematical definitions

## Even and Odd Numbers:

- An integer x is even if there exists an integer k such that x = 2k.
- An integer x is odd if there exists an integer k such that x = 2k + 1.
- The parity of a number refers to whether it is even or odd. 
    - Two numbers have the same parity if they are both even or both odd, and opposite parity if one is even and the other is odd.

## Rational Numbers:

- A number r is rational if there exist integers x and y (where y ≠ 0) such that r = x/y.
- In simpler terms, a rational number can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.


## Dividing Integers:

- An integer x divides an integer y (written as x | y) if and only if x ≠ 0 and y = kx for some integer k.
- This means x goes into y evenly.
- The notation x |̸ y (with a slash through the bar) indicates that x does not divide y.

## Prime and Composite Numbers:

- An integer n is prime if and only if n > 1 and for every positive integer m, if m | n then m = 1 or m = n.
- In simpler terms, a prime number has only two factors: 1 and itself.
- An integer n is composite if and only if n > 1 and there exists an integer m such that 1 < m < n and m | n.
- Any integer greater than 1 that is not prime is composite.


## Inequalities:

- For real numbers x and c, exactly one of the following statements is true: 
    - x < c, 
    - x = c, or 
    - x > c.
- Additional symbols like ≤ (less than or equal to) and ≥ (greater than or equal to) are also used.
