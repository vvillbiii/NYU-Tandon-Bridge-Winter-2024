# De Morgan's Laws
De Morgan's Laws are logical equivalences that show how to correctly distribute a negation operation inside a parenthesized expression. 

the first De Morgan's law
- the negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of the negations.
- When the negation operation is distributed the disjunction operation changes to a conjunction operation.
    - ¬(p ∨ q) is equivalent to (¬p ∧ ¬q).


The second version of De Morgan's law
- the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations
- When the negation operation is distributed the conjunction operation changes to a disjunction operation.
    - ¬(p ∧ q) is equivalent to (¬p ∨ ¬q).
