# Sets

## 3.1 Sets and subsets
- A set is a collection of objects called elements. Sets can be finite or infinite. 
- Sets are defined by listing elements or specifying a condition for membership.
- Basic set notation includes ∈, ∉, ⊆, ⊂, and |A|. 
    - ∈ - item is in set - belongs to
    - ∉ - item is NOT in set - does NOT belong to
    - ⊆ - subset - contained in - Does set A have all the same elements as set B?
    - ⊂ - proper set - Does set B have an element that's not in set A? Yes then A is a proper set of set B
    - |A| - cardinality - how many items are in the set?

## 3.2 Set of sets 
- The elements of a set can themselves be sets.
- The power set of A is the set of all subsets of A. 

## 3.3 Union and intersection
- Intersection: elements in both sets. Union: elements in either set.
- Set operations can be combined, using parentheses to specify order.

## 3.4 More set operations  
- Additional operations: difference, symmetric difference, complement.
- Set identities can be derived from logical equivalences.

## 3.5 Cartesian products
- Ordered pair: (a, b). Cartesian product: set of all ordered pairs from two sets.
- Useful for defining relations between sets and counting possibilities.

## 3.6 Set identities
- Laws that hold for all sets: idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, etc.
- Help simplify expressions and prove new identities.

## 3.7 Partitions
- A partition divides a set into non-overlapping, non-empty subsets.
- Partitions are useful for counting and dividing a set into cases.
