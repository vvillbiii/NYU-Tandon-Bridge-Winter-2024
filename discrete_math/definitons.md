* Logic - Logic is the study of formal reasoning.
* proposition A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
* truth value - A proposition's truth value is a value indicating whether the proposition is actually true or false.
* Propositional variables - Propositional variables such as p,q, and r can be used to denote arbitrary propositions.
* compound proposition - A compound proposition is created by connecting individual propositions with logical operations.
* logical operation - A logical operation combines propositions using a particular composition rule.
* conjunction - The proposition p ^ q is read "p and q" and is called the conjunction of p and q.
* truth table - A truth table shows the truth value of a compound proposition for every possible combination of truth values for the variables contained in the compound proposition.
* T - represents true.
* F - represents false.
* disjunction - The proposition p v q is read "p or q," and is called the disjunction of p and q.
* exclusive or - The exclusive or of p and q evaluates to true when p is true and q is false or when q is true and p is false.
* inclusive or - The inclusive or operation is the same as the disjunction (v) operation and evaluates to true when one or both of the propositions are true.
* negation - The negation operation acts on just one proposition and has the effect of reversing the truth value of the proposition. The negation of proposition p is denoted 
 Â¬p and is read as "not p.".
