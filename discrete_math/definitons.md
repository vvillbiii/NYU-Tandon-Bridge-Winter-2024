* Logic - Logic is the study of formal reasoning.
* proposition A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
* truth value - A proposition's truth value is a value indicating whether the proposition is actually true or false.
* Propositional variables - Propositional variables such as p,q, and r can be used to denote arbitrary propositions.
* compound proposition - A compound proposition is created by connecting individual propositions with logical operations.
* logical operation - A logical operation combines propositions using a particular composition rule.
* conjunction - The proposition p ^ q is read "p and q" and is called the conjunction of p and q.
* truth table - A truth table shows the truth value of a compound proposition for every possible combination of truth values for the variables contained in the compound proposition.
* T - represents true.
* F - represents false.
* disjunction - The proposition p v q is read "p or q," and is called the disjunction of p and q.
* exclusive or - The exclusive or of p and q evaluates to true when p is true and q is false or when q is true and p is false.
* inclusive or - The inclusive or operation is the same as the disjunction (v) operation and evaluates to true when one or both of the propositions are true.
* negation - The negation operation acts on just one proposition and has the effect of reversing the truth value of the proposition. The negation of proposition p is denoted 
 Â¬p and is read as "not p.".

* conditional proposition - A compound proposition that uses a conditional operation is called a conditional proposition.
* conditional statement - A conditional proposition expressed in English is sometimes referred to as a conditional statement.
* tautology - A compound proposition is a tautology if the proposition is always true, regardless of the truth value of the individual propositions that occur in it.
* contradiction - A compound proposition is a contradiction if the proposition is always false, regardless of the truth value of the individual propositions that occur in it.
* logically equivalent - Two compound propositions are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth value regardless of the truth values of their individual propositions.
* De Morgan's laws - De Morgan's laws are logical equivalences that show how to correctly distribute a negation operation inside a parenthesized expression.
* predicate - A logical statement whose truth value is a function of one or more variables is called a predicate.
* domain - The domain of a variable in a predicate is the set of all possible values for the variable.

* nested quantifiers - A logical expression with more than one quantifier that binds different variables in the same predicate is said to have nested quantifiers.
* two player game - In reasoning whether a quantified statement is true or false, it is useful to think of the statement as a two player game in which two players compete to set the statement's truth value.
* argument / hypotheses / conclusion - An argument is a sequence of propositions, called hypotheses, followed by a final proposition, called the conclusion.
* valid / invalid - Whenever the hypotheses of an argument are all true, the argument is valid if the conclusion is true and invalid if the conclusion is false.
* form - The form of an argument expressed in English is obtained by replacing each individual proposition with a variable.
* logical proof - The validity of an argument can be established by applying the rules of inference and laws of propositional logic in a logical proof.
